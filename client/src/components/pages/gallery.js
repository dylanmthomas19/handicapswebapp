            The Superarm Lift System is one of the most innovative lift systems that you will find today. While other lift systems rely on ramps and platforms to help people load 
            wheelchairs into vans, you wonâ€™t need to worry about using them when you have one of the Superarm systems from Handicaps Inc. You can utilize wheelchair and handicapped vans 
            more easily than ever before with a Superarm lift.
            <br />

            Handicaps Inc. specializes in creating a range of different products that allow those with mobility issues to go about their lives normally. The Superarm is a great example 
            of this as it gives people the chance to place their mobility devices into wheelchair and handicapped vans with very little effort. They can then transport wheelchairs and 
            more around with them conveniently.
            <br />
            <br />
